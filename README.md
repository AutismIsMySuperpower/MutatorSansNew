# MutatorSans
![](mutatormasters.png	)
This project consists of [UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org) source font data for a small 2 dimensional [designspace](https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument). Intended for testing all sorts of [variable and mutator math](https://github.com/LettError/MutatorMath) and making it not look stupid. I may or may not add to the characterset. 

## Disclaimer
As it is a testing animal it might contain data that is not appropriate for release. The name *MutatorSans* has not been checked for copyrights. The outlines are definitely drawn by me.
